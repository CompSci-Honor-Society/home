## ABOUT
This is the website repository for Computer Science Honor Society. 
## INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTRIBUTORS
If you are going to contribute, please create a new branch (forking the repository), then creating a pull request.
Have your pull request peer reviewed by a partner or two to check for any database or critical errors. Then edit your pull request 
with "REVIEWED: @CURATOR @CURATOR2 @CURATOR3". 

Your pull request will be checked for the approval before being merged into the main branch. This is to implement version control and prevent unchecked bugs / errors coming onto the main branch. 

Please be patient if a admin does not get to your pull request in time! Send a email or message over discord/ something else.
